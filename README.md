HyperMask lets users without MetaMask installed still participate in the decentralized app party. App developers can add just six lines of code, and let anyone send and recieve payments, execute smart contracts, and sign messages. [Learn more about HyperMask at the main repo](https://github.com/hypermask/hypermask).

## Examples

HyperMask is really easy to integrate into your Ethereum DApp. We've got a few examples in this repository of how exactly to do it. Maybe if we have enough time we'll expand it out to a few nifty sample apps that you can use as inspiration for your next great idea.
